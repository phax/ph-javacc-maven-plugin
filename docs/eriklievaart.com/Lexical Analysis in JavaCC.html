<span class="author">Author: Erik Lievaart</span>

In the previous installment, I showed the basics for getting a JavaCC compiler up and running.
In this article, we will take a look at the nitty gritty of lexical analysis in JavaCC.  
There will be a little bit of overlap with the previous article, but we will go into much greater depth here.
Lexical Analysis is the process of breaking a stream of characters into chunks called tokens.
Tokens are the smallest unit of information meaningful to the parser.

<h2>Defining tokens</h2>

Token declarations follow the format:

<pre>[KREP] : { &lt;[NAME]: [EXPR]&gt; }</pre>

And here is a rudimentary token declaration:

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;PUBLIC: "public"&gt; }</pre>
The lexer uses the [EXPR] part to match chunks of characters in the input data.
In a later section I will be discussing these expressions in depth. 
The example [EXPR] above simply matches the word public.
If the word public is encountered, then a Token instance is returned.
The [NAME] part defines the type of the token to return.
This type is accessible via the kind attribute of the Token object.
As mentioned in the previous installment; 
the lexer creates a constant named [NAME] for every token that has a name in the ...Constants.java file. 
Technically, you are not required to give each token a name.
You can define anonymous tokens like so:

<pre>TOKEN : { "=" }</pre>

The lexer will not create a constant for anonymous tokens.
 Naming tokens is good practice and I recommend it.
<br>
<br>

When a chunk of characters in the input is matched, the lexer has to decide what to do with it.
This is determined by the so called "kind of regular expression production", which I will abbreviate to KREP.
There are 4 different KREP's:

<ol>
<li>SKIP: Chunks to skip in the input data. SKIP characters are 
typically not for the parser, but are used to make the input readable 
(e.g. whitespace).</li>
<li>TOKEN: Create a Token object and pass it to the parser.</li>
<li>SPECIAL_TOKEN: Do not create a Token, but link it to the next Token matched using the specialToken field.</li>
<li>MORE: Do not create a token, but buffer these characters. The next 
KREP will determine what happens to the characters in the buffer.</li>
</ol>

Most of the tokens you will define will have the TOKEN (meaningful for 
the parser) or SKIP (not meaningful to parser) KREP.
If MORE is followed by a SKIP, the buffer will be trashed, in the other 
cases the buffer will be prepended to the TOKEN / SPECIAL_TOKEN.
MORE and SPECIAL_TOKEN are advanced features and I will illustrate their
 use  at the end of this article.
<br>

You can group multiple tokens for a single KREP using the bar character '|':

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;PUBLIC: "public"&gt; | &lt;PRIVATE: "private"&gt; }</pre>

Note that whitespace is not significant to JavaCC, so your definition 
can span multiple lines. I just want to keep my examples compact. 
Now that we know how to define tokens, let's examine what expressions we
 have available for the EXPR part of the definition.

<h2>Expressions for specifying Token contents</h2>

In this section I will discuss the many different ways we have available to us, to specify tokens.
Some of the examples in this section will require angular brackets to work: '&lt;' '&gt;'.
As a rule: plain string literals never require angular brackets, quantifiers always do. 
I will ignore this issue, because I expect you to give all tokens names.
Naming them automatically encloses them in angular brackets.

<h3>String Literals</h3>

The simplest regex I can think of for defining a token, is a single character:

<pre>"*"</pre>

String definitions in JavaCC are delimited by double quotes. 
Strings can have multiple characters:

<pre>"goto"</pre>

JavaCC supports javalike escape sequences using a backslash followed by  a letter. For example:

<pre>"\t"</pre>

To match a tab.
Common escape sequences:

<ul>
<li>\t tab</li>
<li>\r return character</li>
<li>\n newline character</li>
<li>\\ backslash</li>
<li>\" double quotes</li>
<li>\uxxxx unicode character xxxx</li>
</ul>

If there are alternatives to how a token is spelled, we can separate them with a bar.
For example, some languages have multiple prefixes for single line comments:

<pre>"//" | "#"</pre>

For clarity, the whole definition with name would look like this:

<pre>&lt;OPEN_COMMENT: "#" | "//"&gt;</pre>

A bar between quotes is not the same as quotes between bars. For example:

<pre>"public|private"</pre>

Matches a single token with a bar inbetween the words public and private.

<pre>"public"|"private"</pre>

Matches a single token for the chunk public or the chunk private.
Whitespace is not significant in the grammar file, but it is significant in String literals, so:

<pre>"//"|"#"</pre>

is the same as spaces between strings:

<pre>"//" | "#"</pre>

but not the same as strings with spaces in them:

<pre>"// "|" #"</pre>

<h3>Character sets</h3>

In java regular expressions, we can use a character class for specifying a range of characters.
For example, the regex for a single digit: [0-9]. The JavaCC counterpart is slightly more verbose:

<pre>["0" - "9"]</pre>

A lowercase character:

<pre>["a" - "z"]</pre>

A single alphanumeric character in any case:

<pre>["0" - "9", "A" - "Z", "a" - "z"]</pre>

You can invert a character class by placing a tilde '~' in front of it:

<pre>~[" ", "\t", "\n", "\r"]</pre>

Matches a single non-whitespace character.

<pre>~[]</pre>

Matches any single character (the inversion of nothing).
This suggests [] is also valid, but the empty set is illegal.
Note that square brackets denote character sets.
Strings of more than one character are not allowed.

<h3>quantifiers</h3>

JavaCC supports the following wildcards for specifying multiplicity 

<ul>
<li>+ one or more occurrences</li>
<li>* zero or more occurrences</li>
<li>? zero or one occurrences</li>
</ul>

One or more string literals and or characters sets may be grouped in parentheses followed by wildcards.
The wildcard has effect on the entire expression between parentheses.
For example, the following expression matches any unsigned integer:

<pre>&lt;UNSIGNED: (["0" - "9"])+&gt;</pre>

We can turn these numbers into signed numbers by adding an optional dash:

<pre>&lt;SIGNED: ("-")? (["0" - "9"])+&gt;</pre>

One problem with the unsigned integers above, is that 00001 is a valid chunk.
An integer is either 0, or is is a (possibly negative) digit from 1 to 9 followed by zero or more occurrences of any digit:

<pre>&lt;SIGNED: "0" | ("-")? ["1" - "9"] (["0" - "9"])*&gt;</pre>

The following expression will match everything from the current position in the input stream until the end of the file:

<pre>&lt;GREED: (~[])+&gt;</pre>

Note that using the ? or * wildcard on an entire token will generate warnings; a token should always be minimally 1 character.
If a token is 0 length, then generating the token will not advance the lexer in the input stream.
As a result it will get stuck and indefinitely generate the same empty token. JavaCC will give the following warning:

<pre>Warning: Regular expression for ... can be matched by the empty string ("") in lexical state DEFAULT. 
This can result in an endless loop of empty string matches.</pre>

Apart from the generic wild cards, we can also specify the number of occurrences exactly using braces: '{' '}'.
For example, let's say it is possible to specify colors using a pound sign '#' and exactly 6 hexidecimal numbers:

<pre>&lt;HEX_COLOR: "#" (["0" - "9", "A" - "F"]){6}&gt;</pre>

The braces can also be used to specify upper and lower bounds in an n:m fashion.
For example, say we want to define the token decimal, which is a decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (non inclusive).
Here is an example, which allows a maximum of 4 decimal digits.

<pre>&lt;DECIMAL: "0." (["0" - "9"]){0,4}&gt;</pre>

The lower bound is required, but for unbounded tokens, you can leave the upper bound blank.
Here is an example, which allows a unlimited amount of decimal digits.

<pre>&lt;DECIMAL: "0." (["0" - "9"]){0,}&gt;</pre>

The example above is contrived. It doesn't make sense to use braces here, because the '*' wildcard is more readable.
Use unbounded braces if there is a lower bound of 2 or larger.

<h2>Token matching order</h2>

Sometimes there will be multiple token definitions that can be matched against the current position in the InputStream.
It is useful to have an understanding of how JavaCC resolves these conflicts.
Let's say you have a language that allows the following assignment:

<pre>cookies = true</pre>

The language specifies booleans using the literal strings "true" and "false".
In that same language it is possible to denote variables using the letters a to z.
You have already written the following token for VARIABLE:

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;VARIABLE: (["a"-"z", "A" - "Z"])+&gt; }</pre>

And a token definition for the assignment operator:

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;ASSIGNMENT: "="&gt; }</pre>

Now all that's left is to add a token for the boolean literal:

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;BOOLEAN: "true" | "false"&gt; }</pre>

You can add this token to the end of the file and JavaCC will compile, but the code does not work.
For the cookies = true example, the input is parsed as 
&lt;VARIABLE&gt; &lt;ASSIGNMENT&gt; &lt;VARIABLE&gt;
In other words, our boolean literal "true' is parsed as a VARIABLE, rather than as a BOOLEAN.
Here are two main rules you need to know about how the lexer matches tokens

<ol>
<li>The lexer is eager; longer matches have priority over shorter matches.</li>
<li>Amongst the longest matches, take the one declared first.</li>
</ol>

So, the first rule has priority over the second rule.
If you have the following token declared:

<pre>&lt;GREED (~[])+&gt;</pre>

Then it is unlikely that any other token will match.
The only case where this is possible, is if another token is declared 
before the GREED token and it also matches the rest of the input.
<br>

Let's revisit the cookie example.
The cookie variable is only matched by the VARIABLE token definition.
Next the ASSIGNMENT token definition is the only possiblity.
Lastly, both the VARIABLE and the BOOLEAN token definitions match.
We decided to put the BOOLEAN definition at the end of the file, so VARIABLE wins.
If we had put BOOLEAN before VARIABLE, then the problem is solved and the code works.
<br>
<br>

Now what if the variable isn't called cookie, but is called trueManShow?

<pre>trueManShow = true;</pre>

In this case BOOLEAN matches the first 4 characters; VARIABLE matches the whole word.
trueManShow is longer than true, so a variable is returned for trueManShow.
This is how things work in Java and it is typically how we want things to work.
Now, as a thought experiment, let's say we want to be able give a variable the name true?

<pre>true = true</pre>

There is no way for the lexer to distinguish between variables and boolean literals.
One way would be to have the parser deal with it. 
Return the BOOLEAN and depending on the placement of the Token deal with it differently.
Or, alternatively, remove the BOOLEAN token and let the parser inspect the token image.
Clearly, that is not a well designed parser. 
Parsers should be enforcing semantic rules, not doing the work of lexical analysis.
<br>

Then how about having the lexer keep track of which tokens have been matched?
This way depending on the context it can create a different kind of Token.
Generally, we try to avoid this, because context free grammars are more efficient.
<br>

The real problem I have been ignoring, is that this is bad language design.
If there is no way to duistinguish between a variable and a boolean literal syntactically, then we need to revisit our language.
For instance, we could give booleans a prefix:

<pre>true = :true</pre>

or a suffix

<pre>true = true?</pre>

Now, sometimes the lexer's conflict resolution mechanism is not enough.
Sometimes when we encounter a particular Token, the lexical rules change.
Consider the following HTML snippet:

<pre>&lt;script&gt;alert('&lt;br&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

&lt;br&gt; is perfectly valid HTML, but the &lt;script&gt; Token changes the rules of the game.
Everything inside the script tag should be parsed as Javascript and not as HTML.
To solve this and other problems, we need lexical states.

<h2>Lexical States</h2>

JavaCC ALWAYS uses lexical states. We just haven't been aware of it.
You can specify a lexical state using a prefix in angular brackets:

<pre>&lt;MY_STATE&gt; TOKEN: { &lt;DOT: "."&gt; }</pre>

If no state is specified, then the DEFAULT state is used. In other words, this:

<pre>&lt;DEFAULT&gt; TOKEN: { &lt;DOT: "."&gt; }</pre>

is the same as this:

<pre>TOKEN: { &lt;DOT: "."&gt; }</pre>

All of the tokens I created before this chapter are present in the DEFAULT lexical space.
The lexer will only evaluate Token definitions matching the lexical state the lexer is in.
So lexical spaces are like sub-grammars in the grammar.
The lexer starts in the DEFAULT state (makes sense right?).
When we expect a different collection of tokens that conflict with our other tokens, we need to switch lexical states.
Lexical spaces can be used with all KREP's. 
For instance, the MORE KREP can be used in other lexical spaces as well:

<pre>&lt;MY_STATE&gt; MORE: { &lt;DOT: "."&gt; }</pre>

Of course, defining states is nice, but we also need a way to switch to a different state.
Simply add a colon and a state name after a Token.
Whenever the Token is found, the state is changed for the input following the token.
Here we have an example of a double quote moving us into the STRING state.

<pre>TOKEN: { &lt;OPEN_STRING: "\""&gt;: STRING }</pre>

Anything that is not a double quote will be part of the string body:

<pre>&lt;STRING&gt; TOKEN: { &lt;STRING_BODY: (~["\""])+&gt; }</pre>

The Token definition above will consume anything until a quote is encountered.
You might want to add newline characters to the character set as well, otherwise strings may span multiple lines.
We still need to add a closing quote and return to the DEFAULT state:

<pre>&lt;STRING&gt; TOKEN: { &lt;CLOSE_STRING: "\""&gt;: DEFAULT }</pre>

There are two problems with the code above.
First of all, no STRING_BODY token is generated for the empty string.
This can easily be dealt with in the parser.
Alternatively, we could make a single token for the whole string with opening and closing quotes.
More importantly, it is not possible to specify strings containing double quotes, a common occurrence.
This can be solved with a slightly more complex expression:

<pre>&lt;STRING&gt; TOKEN: { &lt;STRING_BODY: ("\\\\" | "\\\"" | ~["\"", "\\"])+&gt; }</pre>

This slightly hard to read expression specifies that the body of a string consists of characters and escape sequences.
A backslash or a double quote can be part of the string if it is escaped with a backslash.
Any character that is not a double quote or a backslash is valid. 
Note that the STRING_BODY has to be in a separate lexical state.
If STRING_BODY were in the same lexical state as the VARIABLE and ASSIGNMENT operators above, they would rarely work.
Remember the cookie example?

<pre>cookie = true</pre>

This whole chunk would be returned with a single STRING_BODY token if STRING_BODY was in the same lexical space.
In the STRING example, the case for using lexical states is not very strong yet.
We could drop the whole STRING state and simply create a single token for a quoted String:

<pre>TOKEN: { &lt;QUOTED_STRING: "\"" (~["\"", "\\"] | "\\\"" | "\\\\")* "\"" &gt; }</pre>

This is roughly the same expression as the STRING_BODY token above, but we added the quotes to the definition of the token.
Of course, in the HTML example I gave earlier, the rules for the contents of the script tag would be much more complex.
In the HTML example, it makes a lot more sense to use lexical states.
<br>

Lastly, we have the option of defining a Token that will be added to all lexical states.
This is known as a universal Token block. We specify a universal Token block with &lt;*&gt;:

<pre>&lt;*&gt; TOKEN : { &lt;UNKNOWN: ~[]&gt; }</pre>

Adding the listed UNKNOWN universal Token at the end of your grammar 
file will return tokens for any data the lexer doesn't understand.
This effectively prevents the lexer from creating any TokenMgrErrors. 
This sounds bad, but is actually a good thing.
The parser is handed the UNKNOWN Token, but it is expecting something 
else.
As a result, it throws a ParseException instead of the TokenMgrError 
that would have been thrown otherwise.
The reason this is a good thing, is because the TokenMgr would say: "I 
can't do anything with the following character: ...",
while the parser would say: "I am expecting a String literal or a 
variable here, but I got this unknown character ...".
The second message is clearly more helpful.

<h2>Working with MORE</h2>

Let us inspect an example of how to work with the MORE KREP specified at the start of this article.
I am going to continue the STRING example from the previous heading and rebuild it using the MORE KREP.

<pre>MORE: { &lt;OPEN_STRING: "\""&gt;: STRING_BODY }</pre>

Opening the string and changing the lexical state remains largely unchanged. I did change the KREP from TOKEN to MORE. 
MORE will append the characters found to the internal StringBuffer. No Token Object is created.
I am going to call the resulting Token STRING, so I had to change the name of the state to STRING_BODY.
Names of lexical states cannot match token names, because both will generate constants in the ...TokenManager file. 

<pre>&lt;STRING_BODY&gt; MORE: { "\\\\" }</pre>

If we find an escaped backslash, append it to the buffer.

<pre>&lt;STRING_BODY&gt; MORE: { "\\\"" }</pre>

Do the same for an escaped double quote,

<pre>&lt;STRING_BODY&gt; MORE: { "\\n" }</pre>

the newline escape sequence

<pre>&lt;STRING_BODY&gt; MORE: { "\\r" }</pre>

and the carriage return sequence.

<pre>&lt;STRING_BODY&gt; MORE: { &lt;~["\"", "\\", "\r", "\n"]&gt; }</pre>

Lastly append anything other than a quote, backslash, carriage return or line feed.
This verbose option is apparently faster then the previous examples.
Complex regular expressions generate less efficient code than simple string literals:

<a href="https://javacc.java.net/doc/lexertips.html">https://javacc.java.net/doc/lexertips.html</a>

<pre>&lt;STRING_BODY&gt; TOKEN: { &lt;STRING: "\""&gt; : DEFAULT }</pre>

The closing quote will generate the Token Object.
All previously buffered characters will be part of the Token. 
The resulting String will be placed in the Token.image field.
The opening and closing quotes are part of the token, 
just like they were in the QUOTED_STRING example from the previous section.
<br>

Since the MORE KREP does not generate Tokens, we can't just ignore the quotes. 
They are automatically added to the Token.
We do have the option of removing them from the image before returning the Token to the parser.
This could be achieved using lexical actions, but first I will discuss the last KREP: 


<h2>Working with SPECIAL_TOKEN</h2>

Sometimes the file we parse contains metadata in addition to the tokens 
the parser needs.
Let's say we are parsing Java. Examples of such metadata are comments, 
javadoc and annotations.
We could choose to specify the SKIP KREP for comments, but what about 
JavaDoc comments?
If we skip the JavaDoc comments, then we can't use our parser for 
generating the JavaDoc html files.
We would have to duplicate our definition of the whole structure of a 
Java file for our JavaDoc generator. 
We could process them as normal Tokens, but the normal parser has no use
 for them, so it unnecessarily complicates our parser rules.
<br>

In this case, we might decide to use the SPECIAL_TOKEN KREP.
When the parser encounters a SPECIAL_TOKEN, like MORE it doesn't return 
the token immediately.
For SPECIAL_TOKEN, a Token object is created (unlike MORE).
It is linked to the next TOKEN or SPECIAL_TOKEN it finds.
The Token class has a field named specialToken for this purpose.
If the parser encounters multiple SPECIAL_TOKEN's in a row, then it will
 chain them together.
Essentially SPECIAL_TOKEN's are accessed in the reverse order from their
 definition in the input.
Accessing the specialToken field from a Token will return the last 
SEPCIAL_TOKEN that was found since the last Token (or null if there was 
none).
This SPECIAL_TOKEN holds a reference to the SPECIAL_TOKEN before that 
and so on.
<br>

Let's look at a (artificial) example I created for demonstrating this.
I created a JavaCC file for a made up ini-file or property-file like format:

	<span class="source">
		ini.jj
	</span>
	<pre>options {
STATIC = false;
}

PARSER_BEGIN(DemoParser)
package demo;
public class DemoParser {
}
PARSER_END(DemoParser)

SKIP: {
" " | "\t" | "\r" | "\n"
}

TOKEN : { &lt;KEY: (["a"-"z", "A" - "Z"])+&gt; }
TOKEN : { &lt;ASSIGNMENT: "="&gt;: VALUE_STATE }
&lt;VALUE_STATE&gt; TOKEN : { &lt;VALUE: (~["\n"])+&gt;: DEFAULT }

SPECIAL_TOKEN: { &lt;COMMENT: "#" (~["\n"])+ &gt; }</pre>

Every line in the ini file has a KEY consisting of letters, an ASSIGNMENT operator '=' and a VALUE.
Once we hit the assignment operator, we switch to the VALUE_STATE.
In the VALUE_STATE we simply grab everything until the end of the line.
This way even the assignment operator is valid as part of the value.
<br>

In the ini format, it is also possible to specify comments using the SPECIAL_TOKEN COMMENT.
Comments will precede the KEY on the next line, so we can read our COMMENT from the specialToken field of the KEY.
Let us revisit the Tokens class from the previous article and add some code for printing the SPECIAL_TOKEN's:

	<span class="source">
		Tokens.java
			[18:32]
	</span>
	<pre>		for (Token token : tokenize(parser)) {
			String name = DemoParserConstants.tokenImage[token.kind];
			System.out.println(token.beginLine + ":" + name + " =&gt; " + token.image);

			Token special = token.specialToken;
			for (int tabs = 1; special != null; tabs++) {
				StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
				for (int i = 0; i &lt; tabs; i++) {
					sb.append('\t');
				}
				sb.append(special.image);
				special = special.specialToken;
				System.out.println(sb);
			}
		}</pre>

As I loop over the Tokens, I added a nested loop which follows the specialToken chain and prints the Token.
I added tabs to illustrate the indentation. Now all we need is an input file to show the results:

<pre># This file contains the configuration for something
# the following entry configures something for something
something=value
# the following entry configures something else for the same something
other=other value</pre>

Here is the output generated:

	<span class="source">
		output
	</span>
	<pre>3:&lt;KEY&gt; =&gt; something
	# the following entry configures something for something
		# This file contains the configuration for something
3:"=" =&gt; =
3:&lt;VALUE&gt; =&gt; value
5:&lt;KEY&gt; =&gt; other
	# the following entry configures something else for the same something
5:"=" =&gt; =
5:&lt;VALUE&gt; =&gt; other value</pre>

It generated 3 Token objects on line 3 and 3 Token objects on line 5.
In both cases the KEY refers to the COMMENT before it.
On line 3 we can also see that the referenced COMMENT refers to the COMMENT preceding it.

<h2>Generating code in the lexer</h2>

Up until now we've treated JavaCC as a black box. Feed it a grammar file and out comes a parser.
Somehow the grammar file is turned into Java code, but we never influenced what that code does.
JavaCC actually blurs the line between grammar and code.
It is possible to write code throughout the grammar file (in specified places).
This way it becomes possible to insert code snippets into the lexer and parser.
One way of specifying code to invoke is through the use of lexical actions.

<h3>Lexical Actions</h3>

Lexical actions are code snippets that have to be executed for every occurrence of a Token.
Simply place curly braces after a token and enter custom code.
The code will be inserted into the ...TokenManager class.
It will be run every time the lexer encounters the token. 
The following example prints to the System.out every time it encounters a NERD:

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;NERD: (["a"-"z", "A" - "Z"])+&gt;{ System.out.println("Found one!"); } }</pre>

Admittedly, this is a contrived example. Useful for debugging at most.
If we are going to add code to the lexer, we want to interact with more than just System.out.
Here are some variables (and one method) accessible to you:

<ul>
<li>StringBuffer image (READ/WRITE): This StringBuffer contains all the 
characters that have been matched since the last SKIP, TOKEN, or 
SPECIAL_TOKEN.</li>
<li>int lengthOfMatch (READ ONLY): the length of the current match</li>
<li>int curLexState (READ ONLY): the index of the current lexical state</li>
<li>inputStream (READ ONLY):  The stream is currently at the last character consumed for this match.</li>
<li>Token matchedToken (READ/WRITE): The Token that is set to be returned to the parser.</li>
<li>void SwitchTo(int): This method switches you to the specified lexical state (discussed above).</li>
</ul>

The official JavaCC documentation has a nice section on these variables: 
<br>
<a href="https://javacc.java.net/doc/tokenmanager.html">https://javacc.java.net/doc/tokenmanager.html</a>
<br>
<br>

The Token object created for the matched chunk is made available under the name matchedToken.
Remember the pattern for an unsigned integer?

<pre>&lt;NUMBER: "0" | ["1" - "9"] (["0" - "9"])*&gt;</pre>

Let's say that the number is not allowed to be larger than 
Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647).
Writing an expression for this is a pain, because the values allowed for
 a digit depends on the preceding digits.
If there are less than 10 digits, then all digits may have any number as
 long as there are no leading zeroes.
If it is 10 digits, then the first digit may not be larger than 2, the 
second digit may not be larger than one if the first is a 2 and so on.
Conversely, This can easily be tested using a lexical action:

	<span class="source">
		maxValue.jj
			[15:21]
	</span>
	<pre>TOKEN: { 
    &lt;NUMBER: "0" | ["1" - "9"] (["0" - "9"]){0,9}&gt; { 
        if(lengthOfMatch == 10 &amp;&amp; Long.valueOf(matchedToken.image) &gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE) { 
            throw new TokenMgrError(matchedToken.image + " &gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE", TokenMgrError.LEXICAL_ERROR);
        }
    }
}</pre>


We can put the code in a static method in a utility class, so we can unit test it and keep the grammar file legible.
You can even change the image of the token. The parser will see the changes.
Let us return to the STRING example where the quotes were part of the token:

<pre>TOKEN: { &lt;QUOTED_STRING: "\"" (~["\"", "\\"] | "\\\"" | "\\\\")* "\"" &gt; }</pre>

Say we want to strip the opening and closing quotes before returning the Token to the parser:

	<span class="source">
		quotes.jj
			[15:21]
	</span>
	<pre>TOKEN: { 
    &lt;NUMBER: "0" | ["1" - "9"] (["0" - "9"]){0,9}&gt; { 
        if(lengthOfMatch == 10 &amp;&amp; Long.valueOf(matchedToken.image) &gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE) { 
            throw new TokenMgrError(matchedToken.image + " &gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE", TokenMgrError.LEXICAL_ERROR);
        }
    }
}</pre>


SwitchTo(int state) changes the lexical state so:

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;EVANGELION: (["zankoku na tenshi"])+&gt; : ANIME_STATE }</pre>

is the same as:

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;EVANGELION: (["zankoku na tenshi"])+&gt; : { SwitchTo(ANIME_STATE); } }</pre>

Using it here doesn't make much sense, because the first alternative is clearer.
The Java version, however, does make it possible to do more complex checks for changing the state:

<pre>TOKEN : { &lt;EVANGELION: (["zankoku na tenshi"])+&gt; : { if(otaku) { SwitchTo(NERD_STATE); } } }</pre>

The NERD_STATE constant appears to magically appear in the Java Snippet.
 No imports or nothing.
The state and token constants are available in the lexer (and parser), 
because the lexer (and parser) implement the ...Constants interface.

If you look at the generated code, then you will see that the lexical 
action is inserted right in the middle of the TokenLexicalActions 
method.
For example if our grammar file only has the following lexical action:

<pre>TOKEN: { 
	&lt;QUOTED_STRING: "\"" (~["\"", "\\"] | "\\\"" | "\\\\")* "\"" &gt; 
	{ matchedToken.image = image.substring(1, lengthOfMatch-1); } 
}</pre>


Then the TokenLexicalActions method would look something like this:

	<span class="source">
		DemoParserTokenManager.java
			[259:270]
	</span>
	<pre>void TokenLexicalActions(Token matchedToken)
{
   switch(jjmatchedKind)
   {
      case 1 :
        image.append(input_stream.GetSuffix(jjimageLen + (lengthOfMatch = jjmatchedPos + 1)));
          matchedToken.image = image.substring(1, lengthOfMatch-1);
         break;
      default :
         break;
   }
}</pre>

The reason I am putting emphasis on where the code ends up, is that it has an important implication.
We cannot declare instance variables in lexical actions. We need to use a TOKEN_MGR_DECLS block for that.
There can only be one TOKEN_MGR_DECLS block in a grammar file and we declare it like so:

<pre>TOKEN_MGR_DECLS : {
	// TODO: Code goes here
}</pre>

Variables and methods declared here are accessible from all lexical actions.
For example, say we need to keep track of the nesting depth:

<pre>TOKEN_MGR_DECLS : {
    private int depth = 0;
} 

TOKEN: { 
	&lt;OPEN_BLOCK: "{"&gt; { System.out.println( ++depth + " '{' blocks"); }
	|
	&lt;CLOSE_BLOCK: "}"&gt; { System.out.println(--depth + " '{' blocks"); } 
}</pre>

Up until now, I have shown lexical actions concerned with a single Token.
In some cases, you will have cross cutting concerns that address all Tokens or at the very least a sub set. 
This can be achieved with common token actions.

<h3>Common Token Actions</h3>

Common token actions allow us to specify cross cutting concerns for the lexer in a AOP like fashion.
First we need to set the COMMON_TOKEN_ACTION option to true on either the command line or in the grammar file:

	<span class="source">
		common.jj
			[1:4]
	</span>
	<pre>options {
	STATIC = false;
	COMMON_TOKEN_ACTION = true;
}</pre>

This option lets JavaCC know that there is code that needs to be run for ALL Tokens.
Next we need to specify a TOKEN_MGR_DECLS block which contains the code to invoke:

<pre>TOKEN_MGR_DECLS : {
    void CommonTokenAction(Token token) {
    	// TODO: code goes here
    } 
}</pre>

The CommonTokenAction method is invoked for every Token that has the TOKEN KREP.
Make sure that CommonTokenAction method is defined and has the signature as specified above.
Here is an example that keeps track of the longest Token found:

	<span class="source">
		common.jj
			[14:22]
	</span>
	<pre>TOKEN_MGR_DECLS : {
	private int max = 0;
	
	void CommonTokenAction(Token token) {
		if(token.image.length() &gt; max) {
			max = token.image.length();
			System.out.println("Longer token found: " + max);
		}
	}</pre>

That rounds up my tutorial of lexical analysis in JavaCC.
I will post my next installment when I have written up an article on parsing in JavaCC.
